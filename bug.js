This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing an invalid or inconsistent keyExtractor function.  The keyExtractor function is crucial for FlatList to efficiently update and render its items.  If the keys generated by this function are not unique or change unexpectedly between renders, you'll encounter issues like incorrect item rendering, flickering, or unexpected behavior.

Example of incorrect keyExtractor:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={data}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.text}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={(item, index) => index} // Incorrect - prone to issues if data changes
/>
```

In this example, if the `data` array is modified (items added, removed, or reordered), the `index`-based keys will become inconsistent, leading to problems.  React Native might reuse the same key for different items, causing incorrect display or crashes.
